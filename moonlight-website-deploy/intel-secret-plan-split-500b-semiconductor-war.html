The foundry division, burning $7 billion annually, can't compete with TSMC while subsidizing Intel's design teams.</p><p>The separation creates immediate winners and losers. AMD, currently dependent on TSMC, could become Intel Foundry's anchor customer, potentially securing 40% of capacity through a rumored $30 billion, five-year deal.</p><p>But the real fireworks start when Intel Design, freed from internal foundry obligations, begins shopping for external manufacturing. TSMC can't absorb Intel's entire product line without displacing other customers, creating a musical chairs scenario where someone gets left out.</p><p>The government angle complicates everything. CHIPS Act funding was predicated on Intel remaining vertically integrated to compete with Asian foundries. A split potentially violates funding agreements, requiring legislative fixes that could take years.</p><p>Meanwhile, GlobalFoundries and Samsung smell opportunity. Both companies are aggressively pursuing Intel Design contracts, while Chinese foundries see a chance to gain Western customers amid supply chain chaos.</p><p>Industry analysts project the realignment could shift $500 billion in semiconductor spending over five years. It's not just about Intel—it's about restructuring global chip manufacturing for a post-Taiwan scenario.</p><p>The split seems inevitable. The question is whether it happens through strategic choice or financial crisis. Either way, American chip sovereignty hangs in the balance.</p></div></main></body></html>
