EyeSight accounts for roughly 14% of Vision Pro's manufacturing cost but provides minimal competitive advantage in Apple's internal calculus.</p><p>Developer documentation leaked in December shows Vision Pro 2 will feature a simple LED indicator instead—essentially turning users back into faceless VR zombies. The change reportedly saves $480 per unit while making the device 40% lighter and improving battery life by 23%.</p><p>But EyeSight was never about technical specifications. It solved the social isolation problem that has plagued VR since inception. Users reported family members engaging normally when they could see eyes, versus avoiding interaction with a blank face mask.</p><p>Early Vision Pro adopter Maria Santos described the difference: "With EyeSight, my kids would still talk to me during dinner. Without it, I'm basically dead to them when the headset's on."</p><p>The removal signals Apple's shift from revolutionary product to profitable product. Vision Pro 2 will be cheaper, lighter, and longer-lasting—but it'll also be more antisocial, defeating the entire point of "spatial computing" as shared experience.</p><p>Internal Apple documents suggest the company views EyeSight as unnecessary for their target market shift toward gaming and entertainment. But this misreads why Vision Pro succeeded where other VR failed: it didn't isolate users from their environment.</p><p>Without EyeSight, Vision Pro 2 becomes just another VR headset—technically superior but socially regressive. Apple is choosing margins over magic, and users will notice the difference immediately.</p></div></main></body></html>
