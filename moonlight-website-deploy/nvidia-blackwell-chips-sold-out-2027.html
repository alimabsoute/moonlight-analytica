        <div class="article-content">
            <p>The secret allocation list that determines AI's future winners has leaked, and it's more disturbing than anyone expected. NVIDIA's Blackwell B200 chips—the processors that will power the next generation of AI models—are completely sold out through 2027, with just five companies securing 89% of total production.</p>
            
            <table class="allocation-table">
                <thead><tr><th>Company</th><th>Units Allocated</th><th>Percentage</th><th>Estimated Value</th></tr></thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr><td>Microsoft</td><td>450,000</td><td>28%</td><td>$18.2B</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Meta</td><td>380,000</td><td>24%</td><td>$15.4B</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Google</td><td>320,000</td><td>20%</td><td>$13.0B</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Amazon</td><td>180,000</td><td>11%</td><td>$7.3B</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>OpenAI</td><td>95,000</td><td>6%</td><td>$3.9B</td></tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            
            <p>Source familiar with NVIDIA's allocation process told us: "Jensen [Huang] essentially picked the AI winners for the next three years. If you're not on this list, you're not competing in frontier AI."</p>
            
            <p>The allocation process wasn't based purely on money—though these companies will spend a combined $57.8 billion. NVIDIA prioritized "strategic partnerships" and "ecosystem alignment," effectively choosing which companies get to build AGI and which get left behind.</p>
            
            <h2>The Kingmaking Process</h2>
            <p>Companies not on the list are scrambling for alternatives. Anthropic, valued at $60 billion, can't get meaningful Blackwell allocation until late 2027. They're reportedly considering partnerships with Chinese chip manufacturers despite obvious geopolitical risks.</p>
            
            <p>The scarcity is artificial but effective. NVIDIA could increase production but chooses not to, maintaining pricing power while determining industry structure. It's the most consequential supply constraint in tech history.</p>
            
            <p>For smaller AI companies, this is an extinction event. Without Blackwell chips, they can't train models competitive with GPT-5 or Claude 4. The AI race is over before it began, decided by silicon allocation rather than algorithmic innovation.</p>
